# Usage coverage and workflow accounting

## Two different kinds of child work

Native subagents can run inside one provider session. BB workflows instead spawn hidden worker threads with `lifecycleOwnerThreadId`; this is distinct from `parentThreadId`. BB's descendants API currently traverses parentage only. Burn extends the returned family over both edges, including nested workers and workers' ordinary children, with deduplication and cycle protection. The global Spend report continues to sum each thread's own report once. Native transcript calls belong to that own report and are not added again as BB worker reports.

## Sources

| Harness | Source and verification | Remaining limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Host reads `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects` or `~/.claude/projects`, matching exact session identities. Recursively includes `session/subagents/**/agent-*.jsonl`. Repeated API message snapshots count once; the last usage wins. BB fork workers exclude copied source-session API message IDs and calls predating their BB creation time, including copies whose session IDs were rewritten. Tested against an independent inventory of existing real transcripts. | Deleted transcripts cannot be recovered. Host environment overrides must match the provider configuration. Background calls are grouped by timestamp and can appear under a later prompt. Partial session history keeps a previously saved report; without one, partial coverage is shown. |
| Codex | BB usage events. `turn/started.parentToolCallId` and turn scope separate a native child's counter from its parent's, even when BB writes both with the same provider session ID. Verified with a live native-child run and a live BB workflow worker. | Events pruned before Burn observes them lose detail. Previously persisted incorrect ledger records are not rewritten. A native child's model is priced using the latest BB request model because usage events do not carry its model. Different-model delegation therefore needs bridge support for accurate model attribution. |
| OpenCode | Existing read-only `opencode.db` reader follows task-tool children by session parent ID; regression tests cover nesting and recorded/estimated usage. | Existing limits remain: eight child levels and the newest 20,000 messages per session. This patch does not remove these limits or make their truncation visible in the UI. No fresh live OpenCode model call was made for this patch. |
| Pi / API through Pi | Existing Pi log reader uses assistant-message usage and recorded cost. Existing regression tests pass. | Only known BB Pi session identities at the standard bridge directory are covered. Custom bridge directories and arbitrary subprocess sessions are not discovered. No new paid API request was made for this patch. |
| OMP (`acp-omp`) | Host reads exact UUID session identities from `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<project>/*_<id>.jsonl`, verifies the session header even after title metadata, and reuses the incremental Pi-compatible parser. Preserves recorded costs, model-call counts, token/cache/reasoning breakdowns, millisecond request durations and per-prompt tool counts. Logs replace BB event totals. | Standard native session directory only; arbitrary subprocess/native-agent sessions without a BB identity are not discovered. Inherits the Pi reader's 50,000-entry per-file limit. Missing session history is partial; when logs cannot be read, the last saved report or limited BB events are retained. |
| Direct API calls from tools or shell | Counted only if their usage is recorded in an already supported source. | Burn does not intercept arbitrary HTTP calls. Missing telemetry must not be interpreted as zero spend. |

For duplicate OMP session identities, Burn refreshes every matching file and counts only one snapshot: the one with the most complete parsed entries, then the most recent modification time when counts tie. The comparison uses the full parsed-entry count before the retained-history cap. A stale copy cannot hide appended calls merely by sorting first or having a newer filesystem timestamp, and incomplete final lines do not increase the count.

## Why Codex counters need separate identities

A minimal interleaving is: parent cumulative total 100, child total 80, parent cumulative total 220. Treating the child as a parent restart gives `100 + 80 + (220 - 80) = 320`. Separate counters correctly give `220 + 80 = 300`. The regression fixture covers this interleaving and a ledger reload between child and parent events.

The new child-turn map is persisted in the existing ledger state; older states without it still load. Exact separation requires the child's start event. This cannot retroactively repair data whose start/usage events BB already deleted, or a child turn already in progress when upgrading from an older ledger cursor.

## Costs and updates

Transcript usage preserves each call's model, input, output, cache reads and cache writes. Known models use list-price estimates, including the one-hour cache-write surcharge when recorded. Unknown model names retain tokens with no invented price. Custom proxy pricing, subscription invoices and service-tier surcharges are not inferred. Estimated cost is not an invoice.

Claude host reads run on BB event/status invalidation and the report TTL; they are not an independent filesystem watch, so a background task that produces no BB event can appear on the next refresh. Incomplete final JSONL lines wait for their newline. Truncation, replacement and a changed first line invalidate the file cursor. Only extracted usage and short prompt excerpts are cached, not tool-output bodies.

## Reading native-agent spend

This thread includes its own native subagents. With children includes each distinct descendant once. The native-agent figure is a subset of those totals, never an additional charge. The popover shows this thread's subagents; the chip popover offers a combined on-demand calculation: Main agent plus Its subagents equals This thread, then Child threads (including their native agents) gives Total with children. In the side panel, This thread explains only Main agent, Its subagents and the thread subtotal; With children explains the thread subtotal, Child threads and Total with children. Without reported children, the chip calculation omits the last two rows. Incomplete native coverage shows the known portion and omits the main-agent remainder. Expandable rows remain under each displayed thread. Family aggregation includes workers beyond the 50-child display cap, but sends only an aggregate for that subset.

Calculation triggers appear only when there is a breakdown to show. The own-thread card requires saved native-agent rows; child-only native agents do not enable it. The family card requires reported children (including zero-cost children). The chip accepts either. Missing or empty native breakdowns alone show a plain amount without a tooltip.
