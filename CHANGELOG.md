# Changelog

Notable changes to Burn, newest first.

Burn follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Releases from 0.4.0 on are tagged `vX.Y.Z` in this repository; earlier versions were not tagged. Each release's commit message has the full detail, including how the release was checked.

## Unreleased

- Read OpenCode 2 session messages and child sessions, while retaining the older schema as a per-session fallback. Include compaction usage and failed calls without token counts. An untimed failed or aborted call now counts in daily failure totals.

## 0.9.4 - 2026-11-06

Burn stops asking machines that bb says are not connected, and a hidden bb window stops asking Burn for figures. A thread on a machine that bb created for it shows its cost from its first turn.

- **Burn no longer asks machines that are not connected.** Each Aquifer sandbox is a bb machine, and a sandbox that is replaced or parked leaves a disconnected machine behind while its threads stay. Burn kept asking such a machine for its threads' session logs, and every ask failed with "Host is not connected". In about six hours that wrote 13,805 warnings to bb's server log, around 250 per machine. Burn now reads bb's list of machines and follows its connect and disconnect events, and it asks only machines bb says are connected. Threads on the others keep showing the last figures Burn read. When a machine connects again, Burn reads its threads again at once. While bb's list cannot be read, including after an earlier read worked, Burn asks every machine as before and tries the list again. Burn reads that list again, at most once a minute, only when it meets a machine it takes as not connected, so a missed event cannot hide a machine for long.
- **A machine that fails is logged once and asked less often.** A failed read used to be logged every time, and the machine was asked again after a minute whatever happened. Burn now logs the first failure and stays quiet until a read of that machine succeeds or bb says it connected, and then logs the next failure. It asks again after 1 minute, then 2, 4, 8 and 16, and then every 30 minutes, until a read succeeds or the machine reconnects. Reads that fail together count as one failure.
- **A hidden bb window stops asking Burn for figures.** The chip, the cost menu and the over-budget flags refreshed on every usage signal, and the chip read a working thread every minute, even in a tab nobody was looking at. While the page is hidden they skip those refreshes, and the page reads once when it is visible again.
- **A thread on a machine that bb creates for it shows its cost from its first turn.** bb links a thread to a machine it creates for that thread only once the machine is ready, and Burn's shared list of threads can be up to a minute older than that. Burn read such a thread as having no machine and kept that answer for five minutes, so a thread showed nothing until its next turn started. Burn now reads a working thread that has no machine in that list straight from bb. If bb has not given it a machine yet, Burn looks again after 5, 10 and 20 seconds, then every 30 seconds, for about three minutes, and only while the thread is working.
- **The wait for a machine stays cheap.** Each look reads only that thread, and its environment once it has one, never the whole list of threads. At most four looks run at once. A look bb does not answer within 25 seconds gives up its place, but no more than eight reads ever wait on bb together. A look that fails counts as one that found no machine rather than starting the wait again, and the chip reads again only when a look finds the machine. A thread bb has soft-deleted stops the wait.
- **A lookup that finishes after its thread is deleted, or after the plugin unloads, leaves nothing behind.** It used to keep its answer: it could mark the deleted thread as working again, schedule another retry, ask the thread's machine for its figures, or tell the page to fill it in. Now it keeps nothing, schedules nothing, asks no machine and signals nothing, and so does a page read that was waiting on it.
- **A thread whose lookups keep failing stops asking the chip to reread.** A failed lookup of a working thread retried every five seconds and asked the chip to read again each time, with no limit, because each failure reset the retry count. Failures now count toward the same limit of 12 as a thread whose session bb has not named yet.

Each change has tests that fail without it: a machine bb lists as not connected, one that disconnects and one that connects again, a missing machine list, one that cannot be read at first or later, one failure logged once, the wait doubling to 30 minutes and starting over, and a hidden page that skips a refresh, or a repeat read that was already queued, and makes it once when it is shown. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.9.3.

## 0.9.3 - 2026-11-02

The chip no longer greys out while a thread works, and it stops waiting on reads that never come back. A thread whose agent restarted many times finds its newest session again, and a thread that starts a turn shows its new figures at once.

- **A working thread keeps its chip.** The chip used to dim and stop its working animation when a working pi or OpenCode thread's figures had not changed for five minutes. A long tool call does that too, and so does a chip still holding an old answer, so the chip greyed out while the thread was busy. The animation now follows bb's status alone, and the tooltip says how long Burn has seen no new usage, for example "Burn has seen no new usage for 6m."
- **A read that never answers no longer freezes the chip.** The chip and the Burn panel start a new read only after the last one settles, so one lost answer left them on old figures until the thread was opened again. A read now stops holding back the next one after 30 seconds, and its answer still counts if it arrives later and nothing newer was asked. A working thread is also read again every minute even when no change signal arrives. In development, React's remount no longer leaves the chip unable to read again after a signal.
- **A thread whose agent restarted many times finds its newest sessions.** bb lists a thread's events 100 at a time, oldest first, and Burn read only the first page of a thread's session identities. bb records one each time the agent starts, so a long-lived thread can pass 100, and then its newest sessions were left out and its figures stopped growing. Burn now reads every page, and a Claude Code fork reads its parent's sessions the same way.
- **A thread that starts a turn shows its new figures at once.** When a thread started, Burn dropped what it knew of the thread's sessions before looking them up again. Log changes in between matched no thread and were lost, and the figures read before the start were served for up to a minute. Burn now keeps the old details for matching until the new ones arrive, reads the thread again at once, and repeats a lookup that was under way when the thread started, up to three times. A thread that keeps starting through all three is looked up again on its next read, so it never keeps the sessions from before for long. The five-second retry for a thread whose session bb has not named yet keeps its details for matching the same way.

Each fix has tests that fail without it: a quiet working chip, a read that never answers, a late answer kept or dropped, the reread every minute and its stop once the thread is idle, more than 100 identity events for a thread and for a Claude Code fork's parent, a read right after a start, a log change after a start and after a retry falls due, a start during a lookup, and a thread that starts during every try. The test double for bb's event list now pages at 100, as bb does. Three independent reviews found no bug in the change, and their smaller points are fixed here. All 636 tests pass in 42 files, `tsc --noEmit` is clean and the plugin builds. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.9.2.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-11-01

Native-agent counters survive a child sharing its parent's id and a parent waiting on a large fan-out, and bb no longer throws when it resolves pi's env outside a thread. The counter rework is by [Oleg](https://github.com/zom-2018) ([#5](https://github.com/kalindudc/burn/pull/5)), and the env fix is by [Nikolai Berezovskii](https://github.com/brzvsk) ([#7](https://github.com/kalindudc/burn/pull/7)).

- **A native child that shares its parent's id no longer recounts the parent.** A child's usage can arrive under the parent's provider session id without a turn event mapping it to a child, so its counter interleaved with the parent's on one session and every switch back re-added the parent's whole total. The ledger keeps a provider id's recent counters and continues whichever one the new total extends; a total that extends none still counts in full after a restart, or the growth of the newest counter when calls were missed, and only the newest counter's exact total counts as a repeat.
- **A parent waiting on a fan-out keeps its own counter.** Each provider id keeps up to eight counters, and past that the one idle longest dropped — during a fan-out of eight or more unmapped native children that is the parent waiting on them, so its next call counted its whole total again (2160 input tokens instead of 1341 in the new test). The smallest older counter drops instead: it re-adds the least, and the new counter never drops.
- **bb contributes no pi env when it is asked outside a thread.** bb also resolves provider env for pi with no thread, for example when the pi provider is enabled and starts on a host; the per-thread token then hashed null and every such call threw — over a thousand handler errors in a day on one machine. With no thread there is nothing to report for, so Burn contributes nothing.

The new tests cover counter continuation and repeats, the eight-counter cap with the replaced-counter path, and the no-thread env. All 625 tests pass in 42 files and `tsc --noEmit` is clean. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.9.1.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-10-30

The chip's working animation follows the thread again, and busy hosts stop piling up overlapping reads.

- **The chip's working animation follows the thread again.** Burn takes a thread's working status from bb's thread events, and also from a list of every thread that it keeps for up to a minute. A list taken before the latest event could overwrite it. A thread that had just started then showed a still chip for its whole turn, and a thread that had just stopped kept its shimmer until it next ran. A status from the list now counts only if bb was asked for it after the thread's last event.
- **Reads share a pass instead of piling up.** Burn no longer stacks overlapping cost, usage, budget and spend reads on a busy host ([#3](https://github.com/kalindudc/burn/issues/3)). A read already in flight answers identical calls instead of starting another pass, and a figure that changes during a pass invalidates it so a later call never receives the older totals. The sidebar, cost menu and overlay also wait for the refresh they started, and a usage signal that arrives meanwhile earns exactly one follow-up. The coalescing is bounded by the number of distinct requests, not the number of signals; the underlying per-pass work is unchanged, so a first read over a very large thread family can still take as long as before.

The regression tests cover both directions of the status race, and for the reads: shared and separated keys, invalidation while a pass runs, rejection retry, and the read counts a burst produces. All 618 tests pass in 42 files and `tsc --noEmit` is clean. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.9.0.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-10-30

Subagent spend is counted correctly and shown in the existing Burn views, and the readers, storage and report endpoint are hardened after an audit. Native-agent support is by [Artur Karapetyan](https://github.com/architawr) ([#2](https://github.com/kalindudc/burn/pull/2)).

- **Claude Code subagents are counted.** Burn reads Claude transcripts on the execution host, including nested subagent and workflow files. Repeated API-message snapshots replace one another, transcript totals replace the bb events that omit them, and copied fork history is excluded.
- **Codex child usage no longer mixes with its parent.** Native child events can reuse the parent's provider session ID; Burn separates their cumulative counters by the turn that started them and keeps that mapping, so 100 + 80 + 220 totals 300 rather than 320.
- **bb workflow workers count in their origin thread.** Workers are attached through lifecycle ownership, with deduplication and cycle protection, so their spend is in the family total and not only on the Burn page. A later independent prompt to an old worker stays in the family total but is not credited to a new prompt.
- **Native-agent spend is visible without being counted twice.** The popover gains a Subagents line and the details a With agents KPI; the family table expands agent rows under a thread and its children. The amounts remain a subset of the thread totals.
- **The popover explains where the family total comes from.** The large amount shows the calculation that separates the thread from its family, and the popover opens with that calculation closed.
- **A malformed usage line can no longer take down a machine's figures.** Every token and cost field is coerced to a finite number, and a host validates each thread's report on its own, so one bad log drops that thread instead of failing the batch for up to 32 threads.
- **Reports stay inside bb's KV cap.** Native-agent rows fold into an Other row past 50, as models and days already do; a report with thousands of subagents was reaching 588 KB. An older extension's oversized agent rows are folded too.
- **Session-log memory is bounded.** Each log keeps its newest 50,000 entries, all logs together keep 200,000, and an unterminated line over 4 MB is dropped. An evicted log is read again when needed, and eviction follows last use rather than last change.
- **A stale stored pi report no longer disables the server-side budget stop.** Burn defers to pi only while its last report is fresh.
- **`POST /usage` requires a per-thread token.** Burn mints it with the plugin's secret and gives it to that thread's pi session, so one thread cannot write another thread's figures or read its budget. A missing token is rejected before the body is read. A pi session running before this update reports again after it restarts; its cost still shows from the session log.
- **The Burn page reads storage in bounded batches**, not one KV read per thread at once.
- **Price overrides.** A new JSON setting prices router aliases and contract models for Claude Code and Codex threads; unknown models can now show dollars instead of tokens. Changing the overrides reprices held and saved reports, including the fallback copy kept for an offline machine.
- **OpenCode read failures are logged** once per reason instead of looking like a thread with no usage.
- **New threads show their figures within seconds.** A thread's pi session id may reach bb after Burn's first lookup; Burn now treats that lookup as provisional, retries it after five seconds, and tells the UI to reread. Before, the thread could show nothing for up to the five-minute lookup cache, even while the model worked. The retry stops after about a minute so a thread whose session is named by its thread id cannot loop.
- **The Where it went bar fills for a cheap thread.** Its segments used raw dollar amounts as flex-grow, and CSS leaves free space when those factors sum below 1, so a thread worth a few cents filled only a few percent of the bar. The bar now normalises the parts to shares, and the Burn page's token and cost bars use the same fix.
- **Where it went explains a cost it cannot split.** A harness can report one total with no token kinds, which used to leave the bar's grey background visible with four $0.00 rows. That part now shows as an **Unsplit** slice and legend row with a note, and the bar is hidden until a thread has a priced call instead of greeting a new thread with an empty grey bar.
- **The README's local install now says to run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`** before tests, because `npm ci --ignore-scripts` leaves the plugin SDK's test host without its native binding.

Checked with the full suite, the type check, a plugin build and a live install from the checkout: a report without a token was rejected while the session-log reader kept the cost current, and a reloaded plugin restored its settings. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.8.3; the new Price overrides setting defaults to empty, and reports gain optional native-agent detail that older versions ignore.

## 0.8.3 - 2026-10-29

pi threads on machines where `~/.bb` is a symlink show their cost again. On such a machine, bb's file watcher can refuse to watch a folder reached through a symlink. Burn's host entry waited for its watch on `~/.bb/pi-bridge-sessions` before it answered, bb never reported that watch as ready, and so every read on that machine ran into bb's 25-second deadline. Those threads showed no cost, or the last figures Burn had kept.

- **Burn watches the session folder's real path.** It resolves every symlink first, including a symlinked parent of a folder pi has not created yet.
- **A read waits at most a second for the watch.** The figures come from the session logs, not the watch, so a watch bb cannot start no longer holds them back.
- **An error from a watch that is not ready yet no longer starts a second watch**, because bb keeps retrying the first one on its own.

Checked live on fresh remote machines with a symlinked `~/.bb`: the chip of a pi thread there rose with each model call while it ran, and neither the machine's daemon log nor Burn's log had a deadline error. Four pi threads on other such machines, which Burn had never read, got their figures within seconds of the install. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.8.2.

## 0.8.2 - 2026-10-28

Burn's settings survive removing and reinstalling the plugin. bb deletes a plugin's settings when the plugin is removed — `bb plugin update` keeps them, `bb plugin remove` does not — and Burn had no copy of its own, so a reinstall came back with no daily budget, no discount and every other choice at its default.

- **Burn keeps its own copy of its settings**, in its storage, which bb leaves alone when the plugin is removed. It writes the copy at every load and after every change, so it always matches what bb holds.
- **The copy goes back on the next load**, for each setting bb reports at its default while the copy holds something else. A setting bb holds a value for is never overwritten: if you changed it while the plugin was off, your newer value wins.
- **A setting you set back to its default stays there.** The copy records the default too, so resetting the discount to 0 is a choice Burn keeps, not a loss to restore.

Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.8.1.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-10-28

The Burn page stopped jumping. Every usage signal from a running thread refetches the page, and each refetch put the "Loading spend…" line back into the page's flow, pushing the cost cards, the chart and every panel below them down 36 pixels and pulling them up again a moment later. With a few threads working, the page moved every few seconds.

- **The line's row is always there.** It now holds its 16 pixels whether or not it has anything to say, so nothing below it moves when it appears.
- **It waits before it speaks.** The line appears only once a refresh has run for 600 ms, and stays for at least 500 ms once up, so the warm answer a usage signal earns — a fraction of a second over a warm cache — never flashes a line that is taken back at once. The first load is unchanged: the placeholders and the line paint together.
- **"Still reading N threads" still shows** whenever the answer left threads unread, and goes as soon as a later answer has nothing left to read.

A live check on this machine's data (572 threads, 7 days) drove seven refetches over 23 seconds while sampling the cost cards' position every 50 ms: before, the first card's top alternated between 167 and 203 pixels with 14 moves; after, it stayed at 189 pixels. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.8.0.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-10-28

The Burn page opens quickly again when you have many threads. With 1,245 threads, a cold 30-day page took 6.8 seconds and showed only a bare "Loading spend…" box meanwhile.

- **Every thread is read once, not three times.** One shared listing of bb's threads now supplies each thread's title, project, provider, environment and machine, so Burn stops asking bb about each one. A cold page over 1,245 threads made about 2,200 `threads.get` and 1,245 `environments.get` calls; they are gone.
- **The page answers with what is ready.** The per-thread lookup is bounded and runs under the same one-second deadline as the machine reads, so a page over a thousand threads paints instead of waiting for every thread. The threads left over arrive with a usage signal.
- **The page shows its shape while it loads.** The first load paints the cost cards, the chart and the threads table as placeholders, and a refresh keeps the figures on screen with a line naming how many threads are still being read.
- **A background warm-up.** Three seconds after the plugin loads, Burn reads the details of threads touched in the last 30 days, so the first open is warm too.
- The Burn popover's "Where it went" legend no longer overflows its card under a wider UI font, such as a monospace theme.

Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.7.2.

## 0.7.2 - 2026-10-27

bb opens threads quickly again when you have many of them. With 1,155 threads, bb took over a minute to open a thread, and Burn caused most of that load: about 265 calls a minute, averaging 891 ms each.

- **The sidebar's over-budget flags read only unarchived threads**, as the sidebar shows, plus any thread that reported but is not in bb's list yet. Archiving or unarchiving a thread refreshes that list. The first check after a load now reads 26 logs instead of 1,155, in 28 ms instead of 3.1 seconds.
- **The daily budget check reads only threads updated since yesterday or running now.** It runs at most every 30 seconds, so a burst of changes leads to one check instead of one per change.
- **A slow machine no longer holds up an answer.** Burn waits at most a second for a machine, and that machine's figures arrive once it answers. A second request joins a read that is already under way instead of asking again.
- **Larger caches.** Burn keeps 5,000 threads' details and 2,000 reports, so a pass over every thread no longer evicts the entries it needs next.
- **What you will notice:** archived threads no longer get the over-budget flag, the daily budget notification can arrive up to 30 seconds late, and a slow machine's figures appear once it answers. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.7.1.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-10-23

- **The call-time notes name OpenCode.** Burn 0.7.0 counts OpenCode's call times, but four notes still said only pi records them: the Call time panel and its entry in the View menu, the hints on the median-call and failed-call cards, and the card's note on where a thread's cost comes from. They now name pi and OpenCode.
- **New screenshots** of the card with each model's output speed, the Burn tab with its speed card, and the Burn page with its two-row toolbar.
- Upgrading from 0.6.0 keeps your settings, thread budgets and every thread's figures. Settings, stored keys and the plugin database's tables are the same as in 0.6.0.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-10-23

- **OpenCode threads are counted.** bb records no token usage for OpenCode threads, so Burn showed nothing for them. Burn now reads opencode's own SQLite database on the thread's machine, where every assistant message records its tokens and cost. It counts reasoning as output, includes the subagent sessions that opencode's task tool starts, and keeps failed and aborted calls. When opencode's models.dev catalog has no price for a model, Burn splits the recorded cost by token count. Contributed by Nikolai Berezovskii ([@brzvsk](https://github.com/brzvsk)) in [#1](https://github.com/kalindudc/burn/pull/1).
- **OpenCode prompts match what you typed.** Messages that opencode writes itself, such as "Continue if you have next steps", compactions and synthetic tool text, no longer start a prompt. Their calls count within the prompt before them. A prompt's text is the last text you typed, or a slash command's subtask prompt when there is none.
- **OpenCode figures move during a turn.** Burn read an OpenCode thread again only when it started or stopped. During a long turn the chip did not move, the budget stop could not fire, and after five minutes the chip dimmed as if the thread had stalled. Burn now reads the thread each time bb records new events for it, at most once a second.
- Finding a prompt's text reads only the parts of user messages: 1 to 7 ms on the heaviest local session, down from 165 ms. A session longer than 20,000 messages is read from its newest messages instead of its oldest.
- The README credits the OpenCode reader, and the docs say where opencode's database lives and that OpenCode times its calls.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-10-22

- **The Burn page looks back at earlier days.** It showed only ranges that end now, though each thread keeps its last 60 days with use. A Today button, arrows that step back or forward by one range, and a date picker on the dates now choose any earlier day, 7 days or 30 days. "Today" in the range switch is now "Day", since the new button jumps back to today. Clicking a bar in the per-day chart opens that day.
- **A two-row toolbar.** The first row says which days the page shows. The second says what it measures: Cost, Tokens or Calls, the project, and a View menu that now holds the Local or UTC switch beside the panel switches.
- **Links and the back button work.** The page address holds the days shown, such as `spend/7d/2026-10-15`, so the browser's back and forward buttons walk through them and a link opens the same days.
- **A past period compares with the same length of time before it**, such as "vs the day before". It names its dates in the threads table and leaves out the count of running threads.
- **The page remembers your choices** on this device: the range, the measure, the project, Local or UTC, and the price switch. It always opens on the newest days.

## 0.5.4 - 2026-10-20

- **Output speed in tokens per second.** Each model in the card and the Burn tab shows its speed, for example "18 calls · 62 tok/s". The Burn tab gets a Speed tile for the whole thread, an expanded prompt shows its own speed, and the Burn page's Output/s column uses the same figure.
- The speed is the output tokens of the calls that were timed, divided by how long those calls took. A call's time includes the wait for the first token, so the speed reads lower than a provider's quoted generation speed. Only pi times its calls, so threads in other harnesses show no speed.
- A report from Burn 0.5.3 or older still reads correctly.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-10-20

- **The chip shrinks to a flame in the phone header.** On a phone, bb's prompt box starts collapsed, so the chip sat in the thread header. There it squeezed the thread title to nothing and pushed the panel toggle off screen. The header now shows a 28-pixel round flame button, coloured by the chip's tone, that opens the same card. The full chip moves under the prompt box as soon as the prompt box expands. Desktop is unchanged.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-10-20

- **The price switch moves out of the Burn page toolbar.** In 0.5.1 it made the Today, 7 days and 30 days control wrap onto a second row. The toolbar is back to its 0.5.0 layout, and the switch sits under the cost cards, beside the note it explains.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-10-20

- **The Burn page gets the With discounts / List price switch**, shown only while a discount is set. At list price, every figure on the page drops the discounts. Budgets are left out, because they apply to the discounted figures, so there is no daily budget line and the Threads card reads "at list price".

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-20

- **Discount settings, so bb shows what you pay.** Burn's dollar figures were list prices, which read too high for anyone who buys tokens below list, such as at a contract rate. The bb plugin gains a Discount (%) setting, with optional overrides for input, output, cache reads and cache writes. The default of 0 keeps list price. Every cost, budget, alert, the daily budget, the sidebar flag and the opt-in stop use the discounted figures.
- The card and the Burn page say when discounts apply, and the Burn tab has a With discounts / List price switch to compare the two.
- Burn keeps storing list prices and applies discounts when it answers, so a change applies at once, to history too, and is never mistaken for new spend by the alerts. Totals, days and the split by token kind are exact. Per-call, per-prompt and per-model figures use the thread's overall discount when the per-kind discounts differ.
- The pi extension still shows list price.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-10-19

- **Alerts stay up long enough to read.** Burn's alerts in bb closed after 4 seconds, often before you came back to bb. Over-budget and stopped-thread alerts now stay until you close them, near-budget and daily alerts last 15 seconds, and expensive-prompt alerts last 10. Every alert has a close button, and bb's notification center keeps them.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-19

- **The plugin ID is `burn`.** The package is renamed from `pi-burn` to `burn`, so bb's plugin ID is `burn` and the update command is `bb plugin update burn`.
- **A marketplace overview.** `PLUGIN_OVERVIEW.md` holds the long description for the BB Community marketplace.
- **A lighter README with screenshots.** The detail moves to [Burn in bb](docs/bb.md), [Burn in pi](docs/pi.md), [How Burn works](docs/how-it-works.md) and [Troubleshooting and limits](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## 0.3.1 - 2026-10-19

- **The Burn page keeps the days you chose after a quick switch.** A refresh scheduled just before you changed the days, range, project or metric ran with the old choice and replaced the new answer, so the page could show local figures under a pressed UTC button. The refresh now uses the page's current choice.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-19

- **Usage panels on the Burn page.** A Show switch picks Cost, Tokens or Calls and re-ranks the chart, the activity map, the threads, a new Models table and the bars by project and by harness. New panels show token and call totals, the mix of token kinds against their cost, call time with p50, p90, failed and stopped calls, and activity by hour. A Panels menu and a hide button on most panels hide what you do not want, in every bb window. The cache hit rate now covers the chosen days instead of the threads' whole lives.
- **Codex, Claude Code and other bb harnesses are counted**, from the usage events bb records. bb deletes older usage events, so Burn keeps its own copy. Codex and Claude Code report tokens but no cost, so Burn prices their tokens at list price and marks the amount as an estimate, such as `~$1.23`. A model with no known price shows tokens instead. The opt-in stop works for Codex. It never stops Claude Code, which reports only as each turn ends.
- **The bb plugin works without the pi extension.** It reads each pi thread's session log on the machine that runs it, remote machines included, and watches the log folder so figures update live. When the pi extension is installed, its report adds only pi's own budget, its stop and the context window. With the opt-in stop on, a thread without the extension is stopped through bb.
- **Threads that never reported are counted**, such as threads started before Burn was installed and the child threads they started.
- **Archived and hidden child threads count in a thread's total**, so a parent whose finished minions were archived no longer comes out low.
- **A forked session counts only from its creation**, so a side chat no longer counts its parent's calls twice, in bb and in pi.
- **Local or UTC days.** The Burn page gets a Local or UTC switch for which calendar day counts as today, and pi's History view gets a `u` key for the same.
- **A tidier card.** The chart's hover label stays inside the card, the card's actions become small icon buttons, and Copy summary says Copied after a copy that worked.
- bb still reads reports from Burn 0.2, with zeros for the new per-day figures.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-18

- **In pi**, the pill shows what the last prompt cost and the budget state, with a spinner while pi works. `/burn` opens a live overlay with Overview, Turns, Models and History views, and has `budget`, `copy` and `settings` subcommands.
- **In bb**, the chip opens a card with the breakdown, a per-call chart and a budget editor. A Burn tab in the side panel lists every prompt and the cost of child threads. Every thread menu gets a Cost entry, threads over budget get a red flame in the sidebar, and a Burn page shows spend by day, project and model.
- **Budgets.** Burn warns at 80% and at 100% of a thread's budget, in pi and in bb. Stopping a run at its budget is opt-in and off by default.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-18

The first version, named `pi-burn`, for pi threads only.

- A cost pill such as `$4.82 +0.31` in pi's status line: the thread's total, then what the last prompt added. `/burn` opens a panel with cost by token kind and by model.
- The same pill beside the context circle under bb's prompt box, with a hover card that charts cumulative cost and cost per call.
